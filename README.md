# pass-me
A minimalistic password generator and manager for your authentication needs.

# Initial Idea 
## Before the code comes the plan 
I am sick and tired of managing passwords. I am not fond of existing password generators/managers currently out there, so I am making my own.

## Ideology 
Some thoughts behind this project 
* Open source. Let others get down and dirty with the code
* Material UI (maybe) and React practice. 
* A practical application that I will use everyday
* Good, uniform design. 
* No database (as of now) everything is going to be managed by local storage via Electron
* Pages and folders for different passwords 
* Generation section for generating passwords that you can use right away.
* Getting myself to ACTUALLY use multiple passwords to keep my data safe. 
* Finally making something that I will use for my everyday computing and authentication needs.


# Concerns 
* At some point, if it scales, we might need to implement a backend and DB. We can't wipe out peoples passwords if they clear their browser cache. 
* Never worked on a fullstack project with Electron, could be fun to actually implement the backend :D
